# FiberMatWizard

A MATLAB-based toolbox for preprocessing and analyzing fiber photometry data, suitable for calcium imaging using GCaMP or other fluorescent indicators. This tool helps with signal extraction, filtering, normalization (e.g., ΔF/F), and plotting for quick inspection and analysis.

## Features

- Load and parse raw CSV/TXT data
- Baseline correction and filtering
- ΔF/F calculation
- Optional z-scoring
- Plotting of processed traces
- Batch processing for multiple sessions

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- MATLAB R2019b or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox (for filtering and smoothing)
- Machine Learning Toolbox (for mad calculation)

### Installation
